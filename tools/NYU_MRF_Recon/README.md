This toolbox reconstructs quantitative maps of arbitrary MR Fingerprinting data with arbitrary k-space trajectories. The algorithm is described in

The temporal evolution of the magnetization is approximated in a low rank space based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dictionary. The function MRF_dictionary.m provides an example on how to calculate a dictionary and compress it. This function calculates a dictionary based on the pSSFP pattern described in

The compression matrix resulting from the SVD is then passed on to the constructor of the LR_nuFFT_operator class. This class is based on Jeffrey Fessler's nuFFT implementation with min-max interpolation described in

[3] J. A. Fessler and B. P. Sutton, Nonuniform fast fourier transforms using min-max interpolation, IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 51, no. 2, pp. 560-574, Feb. 2003.

The corresponding code can be found in the folder fessler_nufft, which contains a slightly modified version of Fessler's nuFFT. The original and full version of his famous toolbox can be found on

http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/

and I would like to acknowledge Jeffrey Fessler for his permission to make his code available here. 

The LR_nuFFT_operator exploits the commutative properties of the spatial FFT and the temporal compression. The constructor pre-calculates a sparse matrix that combines the interpolation in the k-space of each time-frame and the compression matrix along time. The mtimes function then performs an FFT of each low rank frame and grids the k-space of each low rank frame onto the k-space trajectory of the entire experiment.

The reconstruction itself is then performed by the function admm_recon.m, which couples the low rank approximation of the signal evolution in each voxel to the dictionary by an ADMM algorithm. It further allows also for spatial regularization with an l21-norm penalty. 

An example script can be found in the 'example' folder, which demonstrates the interface of the toolbox on the basis of a Shepp-Logan phantom.
